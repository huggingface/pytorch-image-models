  README: "# PyTorch Image Models\r\n\r\nPyTorch Image Models (TIMM) is a library\
    \ for state-of-the-art image classification. With this library you can:\r\n\r\n\
    - Choose from 300+ pre-trained state-of-the-art image classification models.\r\
    \n- Train models afresh on research datasets such as ImageNet using provided scripts.\r\
    \n- Finetune pre-trained models on your own datasets, including the latest cutting\
    \ edge models."
