Change feature extraction for pre-activation nets (NFNets, ResNetV2) to return features before activation. Feb 18, 2021 Add pretrained weights and model variants for NFNet-F* models from DeepMind Haiku impl . Models are prefixed with dm_ . They require SAME padding conv, skipinit enabled, and activation gains applied in act fn. These models are big, expect to run out of GPU memory. With the GELU activiation + other options, they are roughly \u00bd the inference speed of my SiLU PyTorch optimized s variants. Original model results are based on pre-processing that is not the same as all other models so you'll see different results in the results csv (once updated). Matching the original pre-processing as closely as possible I get these results: dm_nfnet_f6 - 86.352 dm_nfnet_f5 - 86.100 dm_nfnet_f4 - 85.834 dm_nfnet_f3 - 85.676 dm_nfnet_f2 - 85.178 dm_nfnet_f1 - 84.696 dm_nfnet_f0 - 83.464 Feb 16, 2021 Add Adaptive Gradient Clipping (AGC) as per https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06171 . Integrated w/ PyTorch gradient clipping via mode arg that defaults to prev 'norm' mode. For backward arg compat, clip-grad arg must be specified to enable when using train.py. AGC w/ default clipping factor --clip-grad .01 --clip-mode agc PyTorch global norm of 1.0 (old behaviour, always norm), --clip-grad 1.0 PyTorch value clipping of 10, --clip-grad 10. --clip-mode value AGC performance is definitely sensitive to the clipping factor.

Penultimate Layer Features (Pre-Classifier Features) The features from the penultimate model layer can be obtained in several ways without requiring model surgery (although feel free to do surgery). One must first decide if they want pooled or un-pooled features. Unpooled There are three ways to obtain unpooled features. Without modifying the network, one can call model.forward_features(input) on any model instead of the usual model(input) . This will bypass the head classifier and global pooling for networks. If one wants to explicitly modify the network to return unpooled features, they can either create the model without a classifier and pooling, or remove it later. Both paths remove the parameters associated with the classifier from the network. forward_features() import torch import timm m = timm . create_model ( 'xception41' , pretrained = True ) o = m ( torch . randn ( 2 , 3 , 299 , 299 )) print ( f 'Original shape: { o . shape } ' ) o = m . forward_features ( torch . randn ( 2 , 3 , 299 , 299 )) print ( f 'Unpooled shape: { o . shape } ' ) Output: Original shape: torch.Size([2, 1000]) Unpooled shape: torch.Size([2, 2048, 10, 10]) Create with no classifier and pooling import torch import timm m = timm . create_model ( 'resnet50' , pretrained = True , num_classes = 0 , global_pool = '' ) o = m ( torch . randn ( 2 , 3 , 224 , 224 )) print ( f 'Unpooled shape: { o . shape } ' ) Output: Unpooled shape: torch.Size([2, 2048, 7, 7]) Remove it later import torch import timm m = timm . create_model ( 'densenet121' , pretrained = True ) o = m ( torch . randn ( 2 , 3 , 224 , 224 )) print ( f 'Original shape: { o . shape } ' ) m . reset_classifier ( 0 , '' ) o = m ( torch . randn ( 2 , 3 , 224 , 224 )) print ( f 'Unpooled shape: { o . shape } ' ) Output: Original shape: torch.Size([2, 1000]) Unpooled shape: torch.Size([2, 1024, 7, 7]) Pooled To modify the network to return pooled features, one can use forward_features() and pool/flatten the result themselves, or modify the network like above but keep pooling intact. Create with no classifier import torch import timm m = timm . create_model ( 'resnet50' , pretrained = True , num_classes = 0 ) o = m ( torch . randn ( 2 , 3 , 224 , 224 )) print ( f 'Pooled shape: { o . shape } ' ) Output: Pooled shape: torch.Size([2, 2048]) Remove it later import torch import timm m = timm . create_model ( 'ese_vovnet19b_dw' , pretrained = True ) o = m ( torch . randn ( 2 , 3 , 224 , 224 )) print ( f 'Original shape: { o . shape } ' ) m . reset_classifier ( 0 ) o = m ( torch . randn ( 2 , 3 , 224 , 224 )) print ( f 'Pooled shape: { o . shape } ' ) Output: Pooled shape: torch.Size([2, 1024]) Multi-scale Feature Maps (Feature Pyramid) Object detection, segmentation, keypoint, and a variety of dense pixel tasks require access to feature maps from the backbone network at multiple scales. This is often done by modifying the original classification network. Since each network varies quite a bit in structure, it's not uncommon to see only a few backbones supported in any given obj detection or segmentation library. timm allows a consistent interface for creating any of the included models as feature backbones that output feature maps for selected levels. A feature backbone can be created by adding the argument features_only=True to any create_model call.

After almost three weeks of training the process crashed.

This represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the range of receptive fields for each network layer.","title":"Res2NeXt"},{"location":"models/res2next/#how-do-i-use-this-model-on-an-image","text":"To load a pretrained model: import timm model = timm . create_model ( 'res2next50' , pretrained = True ) model . eval () To load and preprocess the image: import urllib from PIL import Image from timm.data import resolve_data_config from timm.data.transforms_factory import create_transform config = resolve_data_config ({}, model = model ) transform = create_transform ( ** config ) url , filename = ( \"https://github.com/pytorch/hub/raw/master/images/dog.jpg\" , \"dog.jpg\" ) urllib . request . urlretrieve ( url , filename ) img = Image . open ( filename ) . convert ( 'RGB' ) tensor = transform ( img ) . unsqueeze ( 0 ) # transform and add batch dimension To get the model predictions: import torch with torch . no_grad (): out = model ( tensor ) probabilities = torch . nn . functional . softmax ( out [ 0 ], dim = 0 ) print ( probabilities . shape ) # prints: torch.Size([1000]) To get the top-5 predictions class names: # Get imagenet class mappings url , filename = ( \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/hub/master/imagenet_classes.txt\" , \"imagenet_classes.txt\" ) urllib . request . urlretrieve ( url , filename ) with open ( \"imagenet_classes.txt\" , \"r\" ) as f : categories = [ s . strip () for s in f . readlines ()] # Print top categories per image top5_prob , top5_catid = torch . topk ( probabilities , 5 ) for i in range ( top5_prob . size ( 0 )): print ( categories [ top5_catid [ i ]], top5_prob [ i ] . item ()) # prints class names and probabilities like: # [('Samoyed', 0.6425196528434753), ('Pomeranian', 0.04062102362513542), ('keeshond', 0.03186424449086189), ('white wolf', 0.01739676296710968), ('Eskimo dog', 0.011717947199940681)] Replace the model name with the variant you want to use, e.g. res2next50 .

The base EfficientNet-B0 network is based on the inverted bottleneck residual blocks of MobileNetV2 , in addition to squeeze-and-excitation blocks .
