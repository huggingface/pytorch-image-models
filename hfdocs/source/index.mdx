# timm

`timm` is a library containing SOTA computer vision models, layers, utilities, optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders, augmentations, and training/evaluation scripts. It provides high-level APIs for popular model architectures and standard datasets, as well as utilities for low-level model manipulation.

```python
import timm

# Load a Pretrained Model
model = timm.create_model('resnet18', pretrained=True) 
```
