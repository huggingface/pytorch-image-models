    """ Wrap Tensorflow Datasets for use in PyTorch

    There several things to be aware of:
      * To prevent excessive samples being dropped per epoch w/ distributed training or multiplicity of
         dataloader workers, the train iterator wraps to avoid returning partial batches that trigger drop_last
         https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/33413
      * With PyTorch IterableDatasets, each worker in each replica operates in isolation, the final batch
        from each worker could be a different size. For training this is worked around by option above, for
        validation extra samples are inserted iff distributed mode is enabled so that the batches being reduced
        across replicas are of same size. This will slightly alter the results, distributed validation will not be
        100% correct. This is similar to common handling in DistributedSampler for normal Datasets but a bit worse
        since there are up to N * J extra samples with IterableDatasets.
      * The sharding (splitting of dataset into TFRecord) files imposes limitations on the number of
        replicas and dataloader workers you can use. For really small datasets that only contain a few shards
        you may have to train non-distributed w/ 1-2 dataloader workers. This is likely not a huge concern as the
        benefit of distributed training or fast dataloading should be much less for small datasets.
      * This wrapper is currently configured to return individual, decompressed image samples from the TFDS
        dataset. The augmentation (transforms) and batching is still done in PyTorch. It would be possible
        to specify TF augmentation fn and return augmented batches w/ some modifications to other downstream
        components.
