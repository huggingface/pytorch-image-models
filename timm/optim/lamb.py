""" PyTorch Lamb optimizer w/ behaviour similar to NVIDIA FusedLamb

This optimizer code was adapted from the following (starting with latest)
* https://github.com/HabanaAI/Model-References/blob/2b435114fe8e31f159b1d3063b8280ae37af7423/PyTorch/nlp/bert/pretraining/lamb.py
* https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/blob/master/PyTorch/LanguageModeling/Transformer-XL/pytorch/lamb.py
* https://github.com/cybertronai/pytorch-lamb

Use FusedLamb if you can (GPU). The reason for including this variant of Lamb is to have a version that is
similar in behaviour to APEX FusedLamb if you aren't using NVIDIA GPUs or cannot install/use APEX.

In addition to some cleanup, this Lamb impl has been modified to support PyTorch XLA and has been tested on TPU.
